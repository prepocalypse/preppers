      <p>Prepping is a philosophy, a movement born in the USA that aims to develop and implement strategies capable of
        guaranteeing safety and comfort during emergency situations. The Prepper - literally "the one who prepares" or
        "the one who is ready" - finds the main solutions to act in protecting himself and his family in case of some
        doomsday scenarios.

        The tools he uses are mainly sources of information, with updates on the riskiest events in his area. But also
        knowledge in terms of survival, such as the techniques for preparing and organizing his own material. There are
        essential items inside every kit of every Prepper. At the same time, everyone knows their personal needs and
        strategies.</p>

          earthquakes, fires, social disorders, nuclear attacks or even cyber.
